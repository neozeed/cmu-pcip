This is a driver for using the Tangent Technologies MacBridge board as an
externally clocked syncronous serial line (such as 64kb).  You must first do
some modifications to the board.  First, remove the faceplate and move the
connecter from J2 to J3 at the bottom of the board.  Next, remove the crystal
Y1.  Lastly, cut the jumper from JY1 to JY2 and solder a new jumper from JY2
to JY3.  Now, the pinout on the connector J3 is:

1 TxD +
2 TxD -  
3 RxD +
4 RxD -
5 RxClk +
6 RxClk -
7 GND
8 TxClk +
9 TxClk -

Some interesting things about the board:

Rx DMA channel #1 (No Tx DMA channel unfortunately!)
Interrupt channel #3

DTRA enables tx driver
DTRB enables DMA
RTSA enables interrupts
RTSB enables I/O ready - wait line

Chn A CTL address = 0x340
Chn B CTL address = 0x341
Chn A data address = 0x342
Chn B data address = 0x343
Clear DMA request after last  = 0x344
