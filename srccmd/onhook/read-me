The programs onhook and offhook are written in IBM assembler language.
The source files onhook.asm and offhook.asm should be moved to an IBM
PC or XT for assembly, loading, and conversion from .exe to .com form.
They do not use a stack, so the loader warning that no stack has been
allocated can be ignored.
