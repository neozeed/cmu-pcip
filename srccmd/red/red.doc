red is a simple netnews reading program.  If you run red, it
will prompt you with a line of the following form:

(current-article/last-article) subject (author) ?

If you hit <cr>, you go to the next article, 'n' goes to the next
newsgroup, 'p' goes to the previous newsgroup, '-' goes to the last
article seen, '.' views the article, s<file> saves the article, !<cmd>
executes a command, g<num> goes to an article with a given number in
the current newsgroup, 'x' exits without updating the red.ini file, 'c'
marks all articles in the current group as read and goes to the next
newsgroup, and 'q' exits after updating the red.ini file.

red keeps track of the articles you have seen already in a red.ini file
in your home directory. Entries in the file are of the form:

comp.sys.vax 123

which means that the 123'rd article in comp.sys.vax is the one to be
seen by you when you invoke red the next time. You will have to
construct the red.ini file by hand and will have to make any changes to
it by hand as well.  To get a complete, up-to-date list of newsgroups,
use the command 'red -n filename'. It will create a file in red.ini
format.  A line oriented editor with regular expressions (like 'ed') is
most convenient to weed out unwanted newsgroups. Invalid entries in the
red.ini file are removed or fixed quietly. You can use a different
file instead of red.ini by setting the REDREC environment variable (the
path is still relative to your home directory).

While reading an article, every 22 lines (21 lines for the first
screenful), you are prompted with the string 'more?' to which you can
answer <cr> to see the next batch of lines, or '.' or 'q' to stop
viewing this article.


				Enjoy, Tom.
